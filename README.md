# High-School-Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing my high school projects, featuring a Shiitake Mushroom Incubator project and my Senior Thesis.

## Shiitake Mushroom Incubator

The Shiitake Mushroom Incubator is an Arduino-based project that automates the incubation process of Shiitake mushrooms. It utilizes a set of sensors to automatically regulate temperature, airflow, UV lighting, and humidity, all based on user-defined preferences. The user can easily select one of the four different incubation phases using a keypad on the incubator's surface. The Arduino code takes care of managing each phase's unique conditions and duration. The incubator is ingeniously crafted from an old refrigerator and features an OLED display, providing real-time information on the current conditions and the selected incubation phase. Safety is a top priority, with built-in hardware safeguards, including circuit breakers, relays, separate power supplies for high-voltage devices, and proper grounding. This repository houses the Arduino code and libraries for this project.

## Senior Thesis

My Senior Thesis, while primarily documented in Bosnian, revolves around the management of a smart home using the Cayenne protocol and delves into the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. The project utilizes a Raspberry Pi with the Raspbian Linux distribution, demonstrating remote control of various devices and automated regulation of room temperature and lighting.

In the introduction, the field of study is briefly outlined. The technical implementation, hardware and software descriptions, and suggestions for system enhancements are presented. The smart home concept discussed in this thesis contributes to energy conservation by allowing remote device control and automated regulation of parameters like temperature and lighting, enhancing household efficiency, and providing greater comfort.

This thesis was selected due to the accessibility of the Raspberry Pi platform, the abundance of open-source code, and the inherent interest in the subject matter. The objective is to introduce students to the Raspberry Pi platform, educate them about the IoT paradigm, and explore smart homes as an emerging technology.
